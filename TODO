do not change init - tini to ifdef()-endif() - use initex.ch via "tie -c" which just undoes corresponding changes. The changes between initex.ch and tex.ch are the following:

-@d init==
-@d tini==
+@d init==@{
+@d tini==@t@>@}

-@!mem_max=30000; {greatest index in \TeX's internal |mem| array;
+@!mem_max=32766; {greatest index in \TeX's internal |mem| array;

-@!max_strings=3000; {maximum number of strings; must not exceed |max_halfword|}
+@!max_strings=6000; {maximum number of strings; must not exceed |max_halfword|}

-@!trie_size=8000; {space for hyphenation patterns; should be larger for
+@!trie_size=6500; {space for hyphenation patterns; should be larger for

To understand what for is texmfmem.h, do this (the second is from web2c-7.5.4):
diff -u lib/texmfmem.h texmfmem.h|colordiff
