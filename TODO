make so that terminal output from test.tex will not be broken

---------------------

this is known "bug" of encTeX. TeX calculates the number of characters of terminal output (for line-breaking) as number of bytes. This processor knows nothing about encTeX. And encTeX is working at different level. The cooperation of these processors is impossible. TeX is unable to know the real multi-byte characters of output on the terminal output. So, it is (unfortunately) possible, that one multibyte character is broken to two parts when line-break of terminal is decided.

----------------------

In EncTeX distribution (http://petr.olsak.net/enctex.html) enctex.ch is change-file for tex.web
(weave tex enctex/enctex.ch).
Print only changed modules - add this to beginning of change-file:
@x
\def\botofcontents{\vskip 0pt plus 1fil minus 1.5in}
@y
\def\botofcontents{\vskip 0pt plus 1fil minus 1.5in}
\let\maybe=\iffalse
@z

----------------------

TeX must know if \mubytelog is activated when it is breaking lines for
terminal output,
because TeX must disable ^^-notation if \xprncode is active for given
byte and \mubytelog is
active.

So, if TeX knows this, it should be possible to create a compatible
version of TeX,
which will not break line in the middle of multibyte sequence.

The algorithm is the following:
1) if TeX is about to break a line, it must verify that next byte does
not begin with 10.
2) if the next byte looks like 10xxxxxx, TeX must keep all the
following bytes and break only
before the byte which looks like 0xxxxxxx or 11xxxxxx.
In UTF-8 sense, 0x and 11x mean the beginning of character, and 10x
means the middle
of character.

Along the way, another improvement to encTeX can be made. We may use
one more feature
UTF-8 for breaking lines at exactly 80 characters wide: the fact that
the first byte (11x)
of UTF-8 sequence contains the length of the whole sequence. It is
sufficient for to TeX to count
just the quantity of 1's in the beginnig of byte before first 0 in this byte.
For example, the following byte of UTF-8 sequence shows that its length is 2:
110xxxxx.

So, TeX need not know encTeX table to correctly format terminal output.

=====================================

To prove that enctex does not influence the output (to justify
git diff 0b40e9f51892b51ba44b940b126c2b0591bbb050..a37b3f7aadca0f286794b36dc46fb08e829616b6 enctex.ch),
convert any document to cp866 encoding, compile the document
via "tex \&test input-cp866.tex"
(where test.fmt is compiled from modified lhplain.ini - convert
hyphenation patterns to cp866 first and generate the format without -enc
option),
and do dvidiff with document compiled via "tex \&ru input.tex".
(maybe use TeXLive's tex binary for testing to be sure)
