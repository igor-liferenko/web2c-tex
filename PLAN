put values to tex.ch, system changes to C-file (like in mytex/) (apply them after `convert' (indent `convert' output first)), UTF-8 changes to C-file (like in mytex/) (apply them after system change-files).

Understand what `convert' does. It creates these files:

        coerce.h
        itex.c
        tex0.c
        tex1.c
        tex2.c
        tex3.c
        tex4.c
        tex5.c
        tex6.c
        tex7.c
        tex8.c
        tex9.c
        texd.h

Try old versions of Web2C from ftp://tug.ctan.org/pub/tex/historic/systems/web2c/ - tex.web must compile and run without any change files.
No kpathsea is necessary.
