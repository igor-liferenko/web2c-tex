-@!trie_size=8000; {space for hyphenation patterns; should be larger for
+@!trie_size=6500; {space for hyphenation patterns; should be larger for

---------------------------------------------------------

The generated code assumes that the type `short' has at least the range
-32768..32767, and that `unsigned short' has at least the range
0..65535.

This is how to compile web2c-6.1:

run ./configure, make (and make install?) in kpathsea/

run ./configure in web2c/

in web2c/web2c/Makefile add -lfl after $(libs) in "web2c:"

in web2c/Makefile change to this:

progdirs = tex
alldirs = $(progdirs) lib web2c
and rm "cd web; $(MAKE) $(makeargs) tangle" from do-tangle:

in web2c/ do this:
ln -s /usr/bin/tangle web/tangle

in tex/Makefile change to this:

program = initex virtex

in splitup.c put "in = stdin" inside main()

run "make" in web2c/
