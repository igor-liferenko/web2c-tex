The following changes must be output by commented diff in Makefile:

-@d init==
-@d tini==
+@d init==@{
+@d tini==@t@>@}

-@!mem_max=30000; {greatest index in \TeX's internal |mem| array;
+@!mem_max=32766; {greatest index in \TeX's internal |mem| array;

-@!max_strings=3000; {maximum number of strings; must not exceed |max_halfword|}
+@!max_strings=6000; {maximum number of strings; must not exceed |max_halfword|}

-@!trie_size=8000; {space for hyphenation patterns; should be larger for
+@!trie_size=6500; {space for hyphenation patterns; should be larger for

This is the plan:
make it work for web2c-6.1, and then using tex.ch-diff (from 3.1415 to 3.14159) and likewise one by one up to 3.14159265, making it work after each new version - pick just necessary changes from each corresponding web2c version; also see NEWS from each web2c version
